            <li> Add the tomato paste to the pan and let it get direct heat to release a more sweet taste</li>
            <li> Add the soffritto back in to the pan.</li>
            <li> Just before the meat is starting to stick to the bottom of the pan, deglaze with the wine.</li>
            <li> Let the wine get up to a boil and when the smell of alcohol is gone add the bouillon.</li>
            <li> Add two bayleaves, the parmesan rine and a pinch of cinnamon to the pot</li>
            <li> Let the ragu simmer for atleast three hours. Check in on the bolognese during the simmer and add water if needed</li>
            <li> Half an hour before being ready to serve, add the milk and the remaing herbs and let simmer for a while longer</li>
